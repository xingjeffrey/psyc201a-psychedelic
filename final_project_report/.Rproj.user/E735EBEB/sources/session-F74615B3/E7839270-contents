# PSYC 201A Final Project Pitch

In most cases, as part of the final project you will have conducted a reproducibility study of a published set of findings in the psychology literature. Conducting that study will involve getting practice downloading datasets associated with published work, exploring those datasets to discover patterns, and fitting statistical models that describe these patterns mathematically. Youâ€™ll also have the opportunity to communicate your findings as part of your final report and flash talk.

Please note that if you have other ideas about what you would like to focus on in your final project (e.g., that is especially relevant to your research interests), please describe them in detail as part of your pitch so that the teaching team can provide you with feedback about how to proceed. 

When you begin working on this assignment, please rename this file by replacing the suffix `_template.rmd` with `_LastName1LastName2.rmd`, where `LastName1` corresponds to one author, and `LastName1` corresponds to a second author, if applicable. There is no special meaning to being the "first" or "second" author. All team members will receive the same grade and credit for this final project. When you are finished writing your responses below, please knit this file to PDF and submit via Canvas.
